## Introduction

This project is made of 3 parts. In the first one, we are going to calculated the trust and power distribution along the span of the propeller. The second we going too compared the result of the bemt with the real result. 

## Usage
The code is really simple to use, you just need to run main.py file and the code will run automaticaly. As the code is really heavy we use some parametere two divided the question for more faster compilation.

```bash
plot_interpolation = False
Question_1         = False
Question_2         = True
Question_3         = False
```	

## Results

The result are going to be shown in the terminal and on the graphs. The graphs are going to be saved in the folder figure.
